    "## What are Computational Social Mixed Methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Social Science (CSS) has offered scientists a new lens on sociological and psychological phenomena, especially through making accessible large datasets reflecting raw human behavior. When processing such datasets a common task is to quantify a latent concept in text (e.g., hate speech), scaling up the classification with machine learning, and using the obtained labels or scores in statistical analyisis for inference or prediction. We use the term <b>computational social mixed methods (CSMM)</b>, because such pipelines include techniques from both the social and computational sciences, as well as qualitative and quantitative approaches. Because CSMM combine multiple methodologies from fields that were unrelated only a few years ago, executing them well is challenging."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial is aimed at both computational and social science scholars with at least basic knowledge in Python. An advantage is to be familiar with common machine learning libraries scikit learn, scipy, transformers, datasets, and torch. Furthermore, it will be beneficial to be accustomed to basic machine learning terminology (such as train-test-split, or common evaluation metrics such as the F1 score). In case you first need to familiarize yourself with those concepts, please refer to the accompanying publication (Herderich et al., 2026; see below)."

    "The figure below illustrates the workflow of a CSMM pipeline. Not all steps in the pipeline lend themselves equally to illustrate with code. Therefore, we focus on the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In <b>data annotation</b>, we cover calculating interrater reliability, sampling training data to be annotate from a larger corpus, as well as Iterative Annotation as a strategy against unbalanced training data.\n",
    "  - In <b>model training</b>, we elaborate on LLMs versus traditional transformers as classifiers, show how to measure model performance, n-fold cross validation, masked language modeling, hyperparameter tuning, as well as a training strategy called Training on Confident Examples.\n",
    "  - In <b>statistical analysis</b>, we explain how to account for classifier inaccuracies in group comparisons by empirically determining classifier thresholds assigning samples to groups, and how to execute bootstrapping based on a classifier's false positive and false negative rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parts marked in blue are original solutions to the respective challenges. For a broader literature review on solutions for all steps of the pipeline, we kindly refer to the publication."
